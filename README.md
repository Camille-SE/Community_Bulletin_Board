# Community-Bulletine-Board

## Project-Two-Description
For this project we have decided to create a bullentin board webpage where people can search within their community and be able to see events and things for sale nearby. This will include the location of the event, the price of the event and may have the ability to see future events. 

The page will also include "today's event" so that the user can select that event and see all the details. Users will also be able to post, edit and delete their own items that they have for sale.

## Planning
![ERD] (ERD.png)
For this project we created an ERD *shown above* to demonstrate the connection of pages starting with the bulletin board homepage which will include For Sale and Events. If the user would click on For Sale, this would take them to the list of all items that are posted For Sale. If the user would click on top posted items for sale, the page would be directed to that specific item.

If the user would click on "today's event" from the homepage, they would be directed to the page of that event, however if the user were to click on "community events", they would be directed to all events listed and so on.

Next we created a wireframe that would roughly show the frame of what we wanted those pages to look like when we were finished. <em>shown <em>below
